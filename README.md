# departure-times-mobile

A mobile-friendly webapp for viewing the Departure Times of the Public Transport in Ulm.


## Hints&Stuff
- Your Webserver should use the provided .htaccess (this allows short links).
- The Platform Stuff (like /1008/2 for Platform 2 at Stop 1008) may brake some things if the script is accessed within a subdirectory. Maybe someone should rewrite thie Feature ;-)
- XML Tag 'delay="-9999"' is not evaluated (delay -9999 means: trip canceled).
- Stop-IDs (in haltestellendropdown.htm) are quite old.
- in /img are some Images for Future use (Favs, Geolocation, Search, etc).
